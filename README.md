## Overview

This is a simple transparent countdown timer application built in Java. The timer is designed to stay on top of all windows, allowing you to track time while working without getting in the way. You can move the timer, resize it, and change the text color using keyboard controls.

## Features

- **Customizable Countdown**: Set the countdown duration on startup using a dialog box.
- **Transparent Window**: The timer window is fully transparent with no background.
- **Stay on Top**: The timer stays on top of all other windows, so you can always keep track of time.
- **Movable & Resizable**: Drag the timer around the screen, change its size with the arrow keys, and adjust the text color.
- **No External Dependencies**: The application runs as a standalone `.exe` file.

## How to Use

1. Download the `.exe` file from the releases section.
2. Launch the application. A dialog box will prompt you to enter the countdown time in minutes.
3. The timer will appear on your screen and start counting down.
   - **Move the Timer**: Double-click and drag the timer window.
   - **Resize the Timer**: Use the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys to increase or decrease the font size.
   - **Change Text Color**: Use the **Left** and **Right** arrow keys to change the text color.
